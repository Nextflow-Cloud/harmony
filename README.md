# Harmony

## Description
Harmony aims to provide secure, robust, and open source encrypted communication with high call quality. It is designed for individuals, communities, as well as enterprises. Similar to Discord and Slack, it is designed with a space and channel structure. In addition to providing a secure communication platform, developers may build upon the platform much easier than other platforms.  

This repository includes the core server software. It's free to self-host or use any hosted instance. Enterprise customers will have the option to purchase support services and hosted instances. Authentication is meant to be used with the [Nextflow SSO authentication service](https://github.com/Nextflow-Cloud/sso-system). OAuth2 will be supported in the future.

The Harmony client currently only exists for browsers. Other clients will be developed in the future.

Note: Harmony is not a federated service for the sake of simplicity. It is a centralized service that can be self-hosted.
